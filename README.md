## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Actually, while doing this challenge, as usual, I made mistakes. But thanks to those errors, and thanks to some pages, I was able to learn how to fix them, maybe not all of them, maybe the code has several errors, but they are things that can be improved by practicing. Thanks to this challenge, I was also able to learn more about CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://es.stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me fix some issues with my logic in React.

- [CSS|MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me to create the responsive part of the page.
